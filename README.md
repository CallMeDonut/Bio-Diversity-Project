# Bio Diversity

The datasets in this project were provided by codeacademy.com. 
In this project I did some exploratory analysis on the conservation
status of different species. All questions answered were also
provided by codeacademy, giving me more practice on being able
to provide answers to things other may expect me to answer, rather
than answer my own.
